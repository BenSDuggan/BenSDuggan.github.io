## Cardiology

* People can faint if they press on their neck while shaving or buttoning a shirt. This is because increased pressure in carotides is sensed by the caroted baroreceptors, causing decreased HR and decreased TPR.
* The heart get's it's blood during diastole. Thus it gets less blood flow if you are tachycardic.


## Derm

* People with darker skin have an increased number of melanosomes but not an increased number of melanocytes.


## Endocrinology

* Ethanol inhibits the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, leading to decreased ADH release from the posterior pituitary and increased urine output
* GH extracted from cadavers were used to treat GHD but withdrawn in 1985 because of prion disease risk
* Decreased libido in primary hypothyrosism is casued by increased TSH which increases prolactin which decreases libido


## Pulmonology

* Patients with COPD can have symptoms exaserbated if placed on 100% O2 because respiratory drive comes from O2 instead of CO2
* Being older can help you recover from coding. If a patient codes, there is hypoxia to the brain. This causes swelling of the brain. Because the brains of older people have shrunk slightly, they can respond better to these injuries.


## Microbioogy

* Hepatitis C uses the LDL receptor to attach and enter cells


## MSK

* Fibrocartilage unions (symphysis) such as the pebic symphysis or IV disks can estimate age (up to 50 years old)
* Articular cartillage is oriented perpendicular to bone on the basal surface for strength and parallel on the articular surface for sliding
* The synovial membrane is highly innervated and plays a role in proprioception
* Similar types of muscle fibers after renervation


## Neurology

* Right sided hemineglect uncomon because there is left/right brain redundancy
* Upper face has bi-lateral innervation but lower only has controlateral
* Diabeties incipitus vs melitus name
* Cushingâ€™s Triad: HTN, bradycardia, irregular respiration (Lincon)
* Cocain can be used to diagnose Horner Syndrome. Administer cocaine eye drops. Normal eye will dilate but the eye with Horner syndrome will not.
* Muscle strain while reading
* NO will increase volume. 50% NO leads to doubling caivty size. Don't use with pneumothorax
* Patients with Wilson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can get [wing-beating tremor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7ZLT0J431s&ab_channel=JAMANetwork) when they raise a flexed elbow in front of them
* If you lose V1 you cannot produce tears from eye iritation, but can cry from emotional distress.
* Species like hmans form the neural tube using primary neurlation (neural plate bends up and fuses) while other animals (e.g. birds) use secondary neurallation (tube forms and is hollowed out). Secondary neuralation is important for formation of the caudal part of the spine.


## Hematology

* Blue light can be used to treat excess billirubin buildup in children


## Infecious disease

* Chlamydia is facultative intracelular because it cannot create its own ATP


## Reproductive

* The left flopian tube can pick up an egg from the right ovary. Meaning patients without a right flopian tube and left ovary can still get pregnant (works vis-versa too).
* We didn't start the fire talks about thalidomide kids
* The fetus is soly resonsible for developing the umbilical cord
* When pregnant women lie flat they can compress the IVC --> decreased CO --> reflex tacicardia
* Blue vision with sildinophil (viagra) because of PDE6 cross reactivity
* DES was used by the British to chemically castorte gay men convited of "gross indecency" including Alan Turing
