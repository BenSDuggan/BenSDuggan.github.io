	<h2>JavaScript Questions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>When would be an instance where validation is useful in a website?</li>
		<ul><li>One instance where it is useful is to check to see if a username that a user enters is using any invalid characters.</li></ul>
		<li>What would happen if your HTML code did not have either “bulbon” or “bulboff” as the original source for the picture? Try and see what happens if you change he picture to some new image without changing the JavaScript function. Why does it behave this way?
</li>
		<ul><li>When you click the image that doesn't start as bulbon or bulboff it falls back to the else statement which is bult on.  So when someone clicks the image, it will then go to bulbon.  After this it will go back to bulb off if you click it again.</li></ul>
