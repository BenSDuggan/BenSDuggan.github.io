		<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What is the correct syntax for a while loop? 
				<ul>
					<li>A while loop must first have a method of stoping it so that it won't run in forever.  For example, a variable that starts True and then you change it to False to stop the loop or when a variable gets to a certain size.  Then you must have the actuall while loop statment with the break case.  Then you indent and put the content of the while loop.</li>
					<li>Here's an example:</li>
					<ul><li>myCase=0</li><li>while myCase < 10:</li><li class="indent">#code that gets loped</li><li class="indent">print(myCase)</li><li class="indent">myCase=myCase+1</li></ul>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>What is a good use of remove in a program?
				<ul><li>In my program one good use was removing the users favorite ice cream from the array of ice creams so the computer could pick a different one.</li></ul>
