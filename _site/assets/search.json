        "excerpt": "Albert Einstein’s 1905 Theory of Special Relativity was a revolutionary theory that changed the way we think about space and time. Built off just two postulates: 1) that the speed of light is constant (around 300,000,000 meters per second) and 2) that the laws of physics apply equally in all inertial reference frames. The insight for this theory’s creation was obtained when Einstein asked a simple question: what would you see if you were traveling close to the speed of light. In 1905 while riding a bus he looked back at the clock tower in Burn, Switzerland and wondered what he would see if he looked at the clock as the bus was traveling near the speed of light. He concluded that he would see time slower relative to the people at rest next to the clock.\n\n",

He concluded that he would see time slower relative to the people at rest next to the clock.\n\nHow can time appear to move slower for Einstein and normal to people at rest? He concluded that as you travel faster and faster time slows down relative to an observer at rest. Through a simple derivation he then found this equation: t = gamma * tau. Tau is known as the proper time which is the time elapsed by the person that experienced the start and end event. Gamma is also known as the Lorentz factor and describes how much time dilation occurs. The Lorentz factor is equal to 1 divided the square root of 1 minus the squared of the relative velocity divided by the speed of light (1/sqrt[1-(v/c)^2]). t is the time experienced by the observer at rest. Sense the Lorentz factor has a range of 1 to infinity it has a range of tau to infinity. This means that t can never be less than tau and at any speed will be greater than tau.  More about special relativity and the derivation for this formula can be found here.\n\nThis simulator used this formula to compare Einstein’s time to the clock tower’s time.  This simulator was built using p5.js.  The proper time, or reference frame which is moving, can be changed with the buttons in the lower left corner.  The speed is adjusted with the slider in the lower right corner.  Below is the built simulator and the code for it.\n\n\n",

The goal of the system is to provide a way to collect data off of RFID readers wirellsy, store them on a server and provide annalysis and managment tool for that data.\n\nAbstract from SICB 2019 Conferance\nCost-effective radio frequency identification (RFID) technology allows biologists to track the movement of tagged animals using short range antennas. Current reader designs generally record data to memory cards, to be manually uploaded and analyzed on a computer. While this approach may be sufficient for some projects, it does not lend itself to the deployment of large numbers of readers over large geographical areas, without significant logistical drawbacks. Here, we have created a system that wirelessly collects data from readers, stores data on a central server, and transmits data over a locally-generated Wi-Fi network to allow for real-time viewing and basic analysis on a computer or mobile device. This system uses a Raspberry Pi mini-computer, an Arduino board, and a transceiver radio module on every device in the RFID network. We will present the results of simulated and real-world tests of this system to validate radio range, ensure reliability of data transfer, and measure effects on battery life. Furthermore, we elaborate on additional features, such as networking radios together to increase range and integrating mobile hotspots to allow remote data access. This system can facilitate new, ambitious experiments that further extend the scope of behavioral questions that can be answered using RFID technology.\n",
