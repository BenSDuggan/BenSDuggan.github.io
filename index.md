Welcome to my personal website devoted to displaying my personal projects.  Originally, I am from St. Lousis, Missouri and am currently a senior at Indiana University Bloomington.  I'm majoring in computer science with a specialty in intelligent systems and minoring in chemistry and math.  My goal is to go to medical schools and practice medicine and do clinical research.  I would like to do research combining health care and computing to improve patient outcomes and lower prices.  My research portfolio includes building a wireless network of RFID readers, agent-based cancer modeling and prediction & analysis of neoantigens in colorectal cancer.
