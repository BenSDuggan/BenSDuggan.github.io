Welcome to my personal website devoted to displaying my personal projects.  I am from St. Louis, Missouri and just finished my undergraduate studies at Indiana University Bloomington.  I majored in computer science with a specialty in intelligent systems and minored in chemistry.  Currently, I am a first year medical student at Indiana University School of Medicine.  My goal is to practice medicine and do clinical research combining health care and computing to improve patient outcomes and lower prices.  My research portfolio includes building a wireless network of RFID readers, agent-based cancer modeling, and prediction & analysis of neoantigens in colorectal cancer.
