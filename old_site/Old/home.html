				<h2>About Ben.</h2>
				<p>My name is Ben Duggan and, I’m currently an 18 year old student at Indiana University Bloomington.  I was born and currently reside in St. Louis, Missouri with my parents, brother, sister and dog. My hobbies include programing, swimming, playing guitar and spending time with family and friends.</p>
				<p>At IU I am studying Informatics with a cognate in Medical Sciences.  In the future I hope to combine my programing interests with my medical interests and become a MD practicing medicine and trying to advance the medical field using new technologies.</p>
