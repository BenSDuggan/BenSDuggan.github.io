		<h1><center>Week 1 – Lab 2</center></h1>
		<h2>My Background</h2>
		<p>MY name is Ben Duggan and I am from St. Louis, Mo (technically Chesterfield but people do know where that is).  I went to Chaminade College Preparatory School.I have been doing simple programing sense the 8th grade.  My in sophomore year of school I took Java and then AP Java in Junior year.  Senior year I took a web design class.  I have my own site (although nothing is really on it) which you can check out <a href="http://bensduggan.com">here</a>.  <strong>Fun Fact: </strong> The Mens Gatorade National Basketball Player of the Year went to my school.</p>
		<h2>My Expectations</h2>
		<p>I hope to get a better approach to programming and informatics work.  I hope that I will learn much more than what I already know, however I understand that this is an elementary level course.  I also hope that my skills in programming will be reaffirmed and put to test like they were not in high school.</p>
