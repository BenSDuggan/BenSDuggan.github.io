	<h2>JavaScript Questions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>What is the different between n = 1 + 2 and n = “1” + “2”? If you were to display the contents of n, what would be shown on your page for each instance of n?</li>
		<ul><li>The first case of n is adding two numbers together, which will output "3".  The second case of n is concantonating strings, which will output "12".</li></ul>
		<li>What does the += mean/do? What did we use if for in our JavaScript function?</li>
		<ul><li>This means that you take the var that comes before the += and add it to itself plus the var behind the +=.  It's just a consied way of saying "x = x + y" 
		assuming you entered "x+=y".  It is not just used for numbers; it can also be used for strings.  We used it for concantonating strings during the counting loop.</li></ul>
		<li>What two pieces of code/functions/attributes have we used the last few labs to indicate/identify where our JavaScript changes are going to happen?</li>
		<ol><li>One thing that we have uesd was id tags on HTML elements.  This allows JavaScript to acces the value of that HTML element or set the vaule of that HTML element.</li>
		<li>Another thing that we used inside the script code was "document.getElementById()".  This allows javascript to retreave the vaule of the element you want using its ID.  
		by adding ".innerHTML = ". To the end of it you can have it change the value of a the HTML element.</li></ol>
